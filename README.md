# React-native-boilerplate

React native boilerplate inspired by [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) and [ignite-expo-boilerplate](https://github.com/jbosse/ignite-expo-boilerplate)

## Core

* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (Manage application state)
* [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) (Manage side effects)
* [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) (Immutable data structures)
* [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) (Memoize computed and derived data from redux store)
* [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) (Self explanatory)
* [Expo](https://expo.io/) (Access device's system functionality)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)/[Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) (Test runner/Testing utilities) 
* [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron) (Debugging)
